## React Task

**Create 3 input fields:**
1. Number of rows (`M`)
2. Number of columns (`N`)
3. Number of neighboring elements (`K`)

---

- Fill a matrix of size `M x N` with random numbers from 0 to 100.
- Each number should be in its own cell styled as a square with a border (styling is optional).
- On hovering over a cell, fill it with color according to the percentage of the number inside (e\.g\. 77 means 77% filled).
- On hovering over a cell, highlight the `K` closest cells by value.

---

**Requirements:**
- Implement using React components without using tables.
- Performance will be measured starting from `100 x 100`.
